# Beamforming

This repository contain all my attempt of implementing beamforming at GNURadio.

All of it is done in a simulation manner, this is done to ensure a proper way of doing the estimation.

Implementation on USRP and a pair of antenna is on plan.

Future work should include: 
1. The flowgraph using USRP
2. Out Of Tree module for GNURadio
